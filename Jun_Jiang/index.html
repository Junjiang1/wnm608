				<p>Founded in 1965 as a mail-order veterinary supply company in California, it grew into a pet food and supplies chain. Stores sell pet food, pet supplies, small animals, and fish. Some stores offer services such as obedience training, dog grooming, pet vaccinations, and veterinary care, while also hosting adoption events. Unleashed by Petco are smaller stores that do not sell live animals. <br><br>

					Kutte Love, formerly The Kutte Foundation,was created in 2015 to help promote and improve the welfare of companion animals.An independent nonprofit organization, Kutte Love works with local animal welfare groups across the country to host in-store adoption events and helps find homes for companion animals. The foundation also supports spay and neuter efforts, animal assistant therapy programs, and education about the humane treatment of animals.
